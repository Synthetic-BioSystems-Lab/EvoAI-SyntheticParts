Evo# EvoAI-SyntheticParts
This project leverages AI and ML algorithms to enhance the functionality of existing genetic parts. Initially, it employs genetic algorithms, specifically the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (N.E.A.T.) algorithm, to optimize these components for improved effectiveness and utility in synthetic biology.
